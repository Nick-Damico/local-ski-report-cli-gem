# local_ski_report_cli_gem

CLI Gem for finding a ski resort or ski area report.
This Ruby Gem provides a CLI for locating the most recent ski report from onthesnow.org. This gem allows the user to find a ski area by choosing a region, State, and finally a resort. Once a resort is selected a report is displayed.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'local_ski_report'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install local_ski_report

## Usage

Run gem with command:

    $ local_ski_report

TODO: 
* Expand this gem to include Regions outside of the USA
* Add Additional columns to report to expand upon information.
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
